# Hello-world
Initial repository
This is my first use of Github.  I am interested in developing an IoT project to monitor Barn Owl boxs in Cheshire UK by using the following:

a) Arduino MKR FOX 120MKR FOX 120 board    https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mkrfox1200
b) Adafruit Linear SoftPot (Ribbon Sensor) - 100mm  https://www.adafruit.com/product/178
    or DIY Sensor Film Kit - 4x6" Small Kit  https://www.adafruit.com/product/1917
c) Sigfox network coverage:  https://www.sigfox.com/en/solutions/sigfox-services

And ending up with a message to twitter (or WhatsApp message?) when there is a positive touch.
